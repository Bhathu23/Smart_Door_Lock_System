# Smart Door Lock System

In our country, traditionally we open and close the door manually using a key. It's not most secured method. Anybody can open and enter the room without knowing to the owner. There may be more priority for a particular room. That's why we planned to make a smart lock system which can only access by the authorized people. 

Our smart lock system will operate over wireless network via Bluetooth. The aim of our project is to design a door lock system which will perform authentication of the user as well as opening and closing of the door. Entering and exiting without using those traditional keys is the main aim of the project.

It is an arduino based project. We created an android application to connect the door lock with the phone using Bluetooth module.We used arduino uno board,  keypad door lock,  LCD display, hc5 Bluetooth module, i2c module and touch sensor to make the complete setup. 

Owner can assign 4 digit password to the lock system. He can open the door by typing the password in the mobile application. LCD display and Keypad is attached with the door lock for open the door by entering the password. Authorized people can open the door by using the mobile application or keypad attached with door. Person inside the room can open the door with the help of touch sensor by touching the door.

### **Advantages**

You just need to connect your smartphone Bluetooth to do all that.

### **Disadvantage** 

- It is linked to the possibility of not being able to open the door from out side when the battery of the smartphone is down.The autonomy of these devices is limited and whenever you cannot recharge your smartphone, the risk of being unable to open the door from out side  is possible.This kind of inconvenience is pretty relevant, and it would never happen with a conventional lock.
- A sudden blackout of the control unit or a fault of the recognition device,the risk is that you cannot enter into your house because the system is unable to authenticate you for accessing the premises.
-  When the control unit doesn’t work properly and doesn’t allow you to safely close the door, giving therefore the possibility to thieves to enter the premises, if the problem is not recognized early enough.
- Smart locks, especially those that aren’t updated regularly, can be exposed to tampering. Being electronic devices, they might be violated by IT experts who can create unauthorized fake access codes with smartphones.
- User only can open the door using the mobile app within 200 m surroundings. Because we use Bluetooth module here.

### **Uses of our smart lock.** 
    1.Control of doors and  windows shutters. 
    2.Can be in industries,home,office,shops.
    3.Can be used for garage doors and gates.

### **Future update plans**

- We have a plan to use wifi module or node mcu board in  future, by this we can access the door lock from anywhere. No distance limitations.
And provide a battery to access the door even power is off.
