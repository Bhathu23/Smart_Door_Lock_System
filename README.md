# Smart Door Lock System

In our country, traditionally we open and close the door manually using a key. It's not most secured method. Anybody can open and enter the room without knowing to the owner. There may be more priority for a particular room. That's why we planned to make a smart lock system which can only access by the authorized people. 

Our smart lock system will operate over wireless network via Bluetooth. The aim of our project is to design a door lock system which will perform authentication of the user as well as opening and closing of the door. Entering and exiting without using those traditional keys is the main aim of the project.

It is an arduino based project. We created an android application to connect the door lock with the phone using Bluetooth module.We used arduino uno board,  keypad door lock,  LCD display, hc5 Bluetooth module, i2c module and touch sensor to make the complete setup. 

Owner can assign 4 digit password to the lock system. He can open the door by typing the password in the mobile application. LCD display and Keypad is attached with the door lock for open the door by entering the password. Authorized people can open the door by using the mobile application or keypad attached with door. Person inside the room can open the door with the help of touch sensor by touching the door.
